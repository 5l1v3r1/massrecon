# massrecon.py

This is still in develop it will be in develop branch until I have a ready release. 

## Summary

This is reconissance tool specific written for OSCP engagements.
For boot2root, hackthebox.eu or OSCP in general I start mostly with the same reconissance
procedure and document it in KeepNote or CherryTree. The intention with this tool
is to automate this procedure by start all reconissance tools and enumeration
and automaticly import the results to CherryTree so you can focus on exploitation instead
of look for the weakest link.
